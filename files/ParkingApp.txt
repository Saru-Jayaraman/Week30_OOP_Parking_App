We will focus on designing and implementing a parking rental application that fits our specific scenario.
The goal is to develop a console-based application dedicated to the efficient reservation and management of parking spaces.

Requirements:
•	Review OOP
•	Class Diagram
•	Design Patterns
•	Collections
•	Unit Testing

Scenario:
In the parking rental app customers reserve parking spots, each with unique details like their name and phone
number etc.
These reservations are linked to specific parking spaces, which can either be occupied or vacant.
Customers have the option to associate a vehicle with their reservation by providing its license plate and type, such as car or motorcycle etc. The parking lot, identified by an area code, consists of multiple parking spaces. This application facilitates efficient organization and management of parking reservations, ensuring a seamless experience for both customers and parking operators.

Here is a list of functionalities of the app based on DAO classes:

Find a customer by ID
Remove a customer by ID
Find a customer by reservation ID
Find all customers
Create a new parking spot
