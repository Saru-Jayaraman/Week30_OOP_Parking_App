## Parking Rental Application
Goal is to develop a console-based application dedicated to the efficient reservation and management of parking spaces.

### Task:
* Creating a parking rental application to streamline parking management.
* Design a class diagram that includes the necessary objects mentioned in the scenario.
* In this system, customers reserve parking spots, each with unique details like their name and phone number, etc.
* These reservations are linked to specific parking spaces, which can either be occupied or vacant.
* Customers have the option to associate a vehicle with their reservation by providing its license plate and type, such as car or motorcycle, etc.
* The parking lot, identified by an area code, consists of multiple parking spaces.
* This application facilitates efficient organization and management of parking reservations, ensuring a seamless experience for both customers and parking operators.
